<h2>My 3 Favorite Films of All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</h3>
<p>
  Sci Fi classic full of great action, charm, and time travel paradoxes for
  everyone!
</p>
<h3>Ghostbusters</h3>
<p>
  Lightning in a bottle when 4 comedians at their peak get together as schlubby
  ghost exerminators in this bizarre 80's classic
</p>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>
  Arguably the greatest film of all time, this period piece about the mafia in
  New York in the 1940s is a masterpiece of filmmaking and should be required
  viewing for anyone with a pulse.
